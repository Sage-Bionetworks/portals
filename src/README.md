## SCSS Compilation Strategy

We are currently using [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) and taking advantage of its [module system](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use). Key differences between the module system and the legacy `@import` rule are

* `@use` imports can use namespaces. They do not load global variables.
* Each file is loaded only once if called via `@use`.

To support building the package without specifying a portal configuration, we have empty overrides files at [src/style/_variable_overrides.scss](style/_variable_overrides.scss) and [src/style/_style_overrides.scss](style/_style_overrides.scss). Without these files, Sass compilation will fail.

We ensure that overrides in Portal configurations are used over these blank configurations by placing the active configuration folder earlier in the order of the (load paths)[https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass#load-path] in our `build-css` command in [package.json](../package.json).

# Adding new components from SRC or the portal

To expose a new component add an entry to the [portal-config.ts](./types/portal-config.ts), this tells the
type system how to treat the component in the actual config.

Note - if exposing a component from the portal side, you will need to make sure that the component is exported from [index.ts](./portal-components/index.ts).

# Key Portal Components

## RouteResolver

The route resolver handles taking a URL and matching it the config. Read more in the [component](./RouteResolver.tsx). This component is also responsible for injecting the access token into the react component.

## DetailsPages

The detail pages ([e.g.](https://staging.adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Explore/Studies/DetailsPage?Study=syn5550404])) give
a deeper dive into a particular portal section. Read more in the [component](./portal-components/DetailsPage.tsx).
